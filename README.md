1. Sourodeep Datta (21CS10064)
2. Mihir Mallick (21CS30031)


The Assembler folder contains the assembler for the ISA.
The Processor folder contains the verilog and memory files for the processor.
The TestCases folder contains 2 testcases for the processor, which are Boothes and GCD for the inputs 12 and 28.

To run both the testcases, run "make"
To run boothes, run "make boothe"
To run gcd, run "make gcd"
To clean the files, run "make clean"
